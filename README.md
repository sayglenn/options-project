This is a project calculating option prices using the Black-Scholes model and a Monte-Carlo simulation. The stock prices were retrieved from [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/).

The website allows you to calculate with any given ticker, expiration date and strike price. Information like volatility and risk-free rate should be filled in by the user.
